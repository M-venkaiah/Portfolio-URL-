Project 2: House Price Prediction
Title

Predicting House Prices Using Machine Learning Regression

Problem Statement

Real estate price estimation is essential for buyers, sellers, and property investors. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on property features such as size, location, and number of rooms.

Dataset / Inputs

The dataset includes:

Lot Area

Number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms

Year Built

Overall Quality

Living Area Size

Garage Capacity

Sale Price (target variable)

Data was obtained in CSV format and processed using Python.

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Removed outliers

Converted categorical variables using encoding

Scaled numerical features where necessary

2. Exploratory Analysis

Correlation analysis between features and price

Distribution analysis of target variable

Feature importance identification

3. Model Building

Models tested:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

4. Model Evaluation

Metrics used:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

Outputs

The final model predicts house prices based on input property features.

Example input:

Area: 2000 sq ft

Bedrooms: 3

Bathrooms: 2

Quality: High

Output:

Predicted Price: $245,000 (example)

Results

Random Forest performed best among tested models.

Achieved R² score of ~0.85 (depending on dataset).

Key influencing factors: living area size, overall quality, and location-related variables.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow including preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The model can assist real estate stakeholders in estimating property values accurately.

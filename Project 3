Project 3: Customer Churn Prediction
Title

Predicting Customer Churn Using Classification Models

Problem Statement

Customer retention is critical for business profitability. Companies lose revenue when customers stop using their services (churn). The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on demographic and usage data.

Dataset / Inputs

The dataset contains customer information such as:

Gender

Age / Senior Citizen

Tenure (months)

Monthly Charges

Contract Type

Payment Method

Internet Service Type

Churn (Yes/No – target variable)

Methodology
1. Data Preparation

Handled missing values

Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding

Split data into training and testing sets

2. Exploratory Analysis

Churn rate analysis

Feature distribution comparison between churned and retained customers

Correlation analysis

3. Model Training

Algorithms used:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

4. Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

Confusion Matrix

Outputs

The model predicts churn probability.

Example:
Input customer features → Output:
Churn Probability = 0.72 (High Risk)

Results

Random Forest achieved highest accuracy (~80–85%).

Customers with month-to-month contracts had higher churn rates.

Higher monthly charges correlated with increased churn risk.

Long-tenure customers were less likely to leave.

Conclusion

This project shows practical application of classification techniques to solve a real business problem. The model can help companies identify at-risk customers and implement retention strategies.
